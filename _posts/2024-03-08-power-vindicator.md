## Notes

Power Vindicator can be very easy to play, yet deliver respectable results by following the steps below:

<span data-aw2-key="F1" data-aw2-skill="28419"/>/<span data-aw2-key="F1" data-aw2-skill="28134"/>Swap your legend when it is off cooldown
or when you run out of energy, it doesn't matter much, and use
<span data-aw2-key="9" data-aw2-skill="27107"/> Impossible Odds while in Shiro, and
<span data-aw2-key="9" data-aw2-skill="26557"/> Vengeful Hammers while in Jalis. You can bind both these skills to the same button to reduce mistakes.

Use off cooldown in following priority:

1. <span data-aw2-key="5" data-aw2-skill="27074"/> Sword 5 Deathstrike
2. <span data-aw2-key="4" data-aw2-skill="28472"/> Sword 4 Shackling Wave
3. <span data-aw2-key="2" data-aw2-skill="29233"/> Sword 2 Chilling Isolation

Dodge to start the fight and dodge when your endurance is almost full. 

Auto attack to fill.

## Crowd Control

Your CC skills are:

- <span data-aw2-key="8" data-aw2-skill="26679"/> Jalis - Forced Engagement
- <span data-aw2-key="0" data-aw2-skill="28406"/> Shiro - Jade Winds
- <span data-aw2-key="4" data-aw2-skill="28472"/> Sword 4 Shackling Wave

However, if you're in a position where not CCing will result in failure, just swap to staff and use
<span data-aw2-key="5" data-aw2-skill="28978"/> Staff 5 Surge of the Mists.
Note that this will tank your DPS and the only thing you can do now is to auto attack (while still dodging and swapping legends).
