## Gearing

- Full Celestial
- Runes of the Nightmare
- Staff Strength/Earth

## Variants

When camping staff,  your build is gear-independant. Run any gear with high defense and healing power. Celestial is ideal, anything works. You will have extremely low DPS, as a note, but it is extremely simple to play and virtually impossible to kill.
