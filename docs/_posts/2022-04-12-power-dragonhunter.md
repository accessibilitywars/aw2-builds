This moderate intensity Dragonhunter build stays in melee distance and uses the strong sustain of dragonhunter skills to good effect.

Several traits and skills have changed since this build was published, damage and utility may be different now.

## Tier Notes

1. Use auto-attacks, <span data-aw2-key="F1" data-aw2-skill="29887"></span>, and <span data-aw2-key="2" data-aw2-skill="9097"></span>.
2. As in 1, + <span data-aw2-key="7" data-aw2-skill="30364"></span>
3. As in 2, + change Valor to Zeal

If comfortable with the above, consider taking a look at adding a Greatsword weapon swap to your rotation. 

As a note, this build assumes you will use some defensive skills with necessary. In particular <span data-aw2-key="F3" data-aw2-skill="30039"></span>, <span data-aw2-key="6" data-aw2-skill="21664"></span>, and <span data-aw2-key="0" data-aw2-skill="9154"></span> are all extremely potent active defenses. If these aren't being used, change them to signets.

## Gearing

- Full Marauder
- Rune of Vampirism
- Sword/Shield Force/Accuracy

## Variants

Marauder can be replaced by Berserker, Knight, or Soldier, though soldier and knight will perform considerably worse. Sigil of Blood can provide an extra 200 hp/s. The <span data-aw2-key="7" data-aw2-skill="30364"></span> slot can be changed to any utility you like: <span data-aw2-key="7" data-aw2-skill="9152"></span> and <span data-aw2-key="7" data-aw2-skill="9153"></span> are both good for defense, but keep <span data-aw2-key="7" data-aw2-skill="30364"></span> for DPS.

This build is especially flexible, as long as you keep Radiance you can change Valor to whatever traits you want. If you get rid of Valor, dump the shield for a Focus.
