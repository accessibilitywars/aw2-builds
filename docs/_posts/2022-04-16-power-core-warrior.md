## Gearing

- Full Marauder armor & trinkets
- Runes of Vampirism
- Marauder Axe/Axe Force/Accuracy

## Variants

Marauder can be replaced by Berserker and Knight, though knight will perform considerably worse.

Keep your sigils the same on this one, as crit is very important and force is pretty strong.

Arms can be traded for Tactics (more sustain, slightly more active) or Discipline (more DPS, much more active).
