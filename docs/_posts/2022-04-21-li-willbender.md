Mukluk released another LI build, this time for the new Guardian EoD specialization, the Willbender.

Several traits and skills have changed since this build was published, damage and utility may be different now.

_Note: I'll do a better write-up later when I have spoons, but the build is provided below. Rotation notes can be found in the video below the build_
