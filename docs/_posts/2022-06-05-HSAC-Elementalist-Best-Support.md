Thanks to the 10 man target nerf, now Tempest can integrate the overpowered healing and Rez power of Staff + Arcane traitline into your favourite Boon Tempest build. Burst heal your group with just a press of a button! (read: Wash the Pain Away)

The core concept is to maximize Water attunement (and thus Soothing Power boosted Soothing Mist) uptime by spacing out Protection on Earth Att from Arcane and Tempest's ability to generate extra Magnetic Aura for Transmute Earth. 

## Gear

- Weapons: Harrier Staff with Transference/Concentration Sigils
- Armor: Harrier with Monk Runes
