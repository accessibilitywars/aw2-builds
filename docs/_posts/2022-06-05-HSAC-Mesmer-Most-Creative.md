It's a Axe/Pistol + Staff Mirage raid build, that can either greed for highest personal DPS, or dynamically swap to a Staff for ranged damage and great boon output, depending on the situation - since each rotation only uses one weapon set and they use identical traits, this swap can happen midfight!
If the alacrity provider dies, you can take over! Kind of. 50% uptime. But still.

## Gear

- Weapons: 
  - Viper's Staff with Bursting/Energy Sigils
  - Viper's Axe/Pistol with Bursting/Energy Sigils
