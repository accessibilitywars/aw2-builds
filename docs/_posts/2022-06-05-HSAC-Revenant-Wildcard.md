The AFK Herald

This is a pDPS Build designed to press as less as possible buttons while maintaining acceptable DPS. While this is a meme build obviously, i am convinced it can help some players to better focus on boss mechanics instread of skill presses
i only have 2 power infusions, so the actual benchmark might be 1-2k higher, especially if you use some more expensive enhancements. I decided not to buy that stuff since many players also don't have them, especially beginners

btw, i did this on stream and my viewers can activate some memes and effects on my stream. my viewers were a bit hyped in the beginning of the clip, so, sorry..
also, i can recommend to watch the whole clip... :P
