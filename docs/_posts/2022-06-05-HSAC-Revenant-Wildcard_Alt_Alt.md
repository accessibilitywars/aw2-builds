Several traits and skills have changed since this build was published, damage and utility may be different now.

Farming mobs from the Halloween Labyrinth and similair events are always a bit stressfull and intense for me, while it should be relaxing. So I figured out a way to maximize loot while minimizing stress
By using Revenants unique aoe upkeep skills and with a few smart gear choices it is possible to have cheap, yet effective, mob farmer
The main objective was to hit as many unique enemies as possible with the least key presses, low budget so just 1 daily completionist could fund it, and to still be able to function against the inevitable champions

## Gear

- Weapons:
  - Berserker Mace/Axe with Perception/Fire Sigils
  - Berserker Sword/(empty) with Rage Sigil
- Armor: Berserker with Vampirism Runes
- Trinkets: Berserker
- Food & Utility: Omnomberry Bar
